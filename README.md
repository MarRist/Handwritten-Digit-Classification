# Handwritten-Digit-Classification

This repository contains kNN, naive Bayes and conditional Gaussian classifiers to label images of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Each image is 8 x 8 pixels and is represented as a vector of dimension 64 by listing all the pixel values in raster scan order. The images are grayscale and the pixel values are between 0 and 1. 

There are 700 training cases and 400 test cases for each digit; they can be found in git a2digits.zip.

# Handwritten-Digit-Classification

This repository contains kNN, naive Bayes and conditional Gaussian classifiers to label images of handwritten digits using the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Each image is 8 x 8 pixels and is represented as a vector of dimension 64 by listing all the pixel values in raster scan order. The images are grayscale and the pixel values are between 0 and 1. 

There are 700 training cases and 400 test cases for each digit; they can be found in 'a2digits.zip'.

### RUNNING THE CODE:

For loading and plotting the MNIST dataset, run /.

For training and evaluating the kNN classifier, run /.

For training and evaluating the Naive Bayes classifier, run /.

For training and evaluating the conditional Gaussian classifier, run /.
